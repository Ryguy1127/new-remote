# This is a little bit about me

# I am a CIT major and am from Preston, Idaho. An interesting thing about that place is it is the place where they filmed the movie "Napolean Dynamite". I love to ride dirtbikes, fish, hunt and basically anything outside. I am not a huge fan of programming simply because I feel I struggle in it but I do enjoy it when it works!
